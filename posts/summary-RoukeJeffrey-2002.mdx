&emsp;O'Rourke&Jeffrey(2002) 不同意 1492 年和 1498 年是全球化最重要的時間點。作者指出「由進口需求及出口擴張驅動的貿易擴張」和「由貿易經濟體間的市場整合驅動的貿易擴張」是兩回事，定義全球化是指跨國商品市場整合，並以商品價格收斂與模型驗證，指出 1820 年代伴隨著輪船、鐵路、重商主義的消亡、貿易自由化的興起以及貿易壟斷的消失，才開啟了世界歷史上真正的全球化時代。

&emsp;1492 年哥倫布發現美洲大陸和1498年達伽瑪開創東行的航線，引發了前所未有的技術、植物、動物和疾病的大規模移轉（transfer）。然而，全球化的標準不僅需要跨境人員流動，並將歐洲資本運用到這些邊疆，更重要的是，還需要打破長途貿易的壟斷，並需要交通技術革命，使大宗商品在各大洲之間的運輸成本變得更低，從而使國內價格和國內資源配置受到國際貿易的顯著影響。
<br/>

&emsp;O'Rourke&Jeffrey(2002) 以商品價差變動為指標，並分析影響變動的因素。研究結果指出，對絕大多數人的經濟生活真正重要的競爭性商品，在十九世紀之前的全球價格不存在明顯的趨同（price convergence），也沒有看到任何證據說明十八世紀以前的長途貿易主要貿易的非競爭性商品—如歐洲出口羊毛布料，進口絲綢、香料、茶葉和瓷器—價格有顯著的趨同。儘管部分商品價差有縮小的情形，但也僅限於特殊情況或非技術革新之因素而壓低了成本。
<br/>

&emsp;藉由英國近四個世紀來的相對要素價格、商品價格和要素禀賦、趨勢(TREND)說明，在十九世紀前，農業和工業之間的貿易條件（相對商品價格，PAPM）及工資租金比率（相對要素價格，WR）與土地與勞動比率（相對禀賦，LANDLAB）緊密相關，而在法國戰爭和《穀物法》廢除之後，也就是19世紀後，兩者之間關係越獨立。WR變數係數正負，顯示開放經濟模型非常符合1828 年後，但與 1828 年之前非常不相符；同時，包含資本深化（capital deepening）及技術革新影響的TREND變數對WR，在1820s年代後具有顯著正相關。1820s後，隨著運輸成本、壟斷、重商主義干預、海盜和國際衝突的下降與減少，各大洲之間的長途貿易得到發展。

&emsp;There are different views on whether globalization occurred in the 1490s or the 1820s in academia. O'Rourke&Jeffrey(2002) distinguishe between "trade expansion driven by booming import demand and export supply" and "trade expansion driven by integration of market between trading economies" which are two different concepts: some historians regard 1492 and 1498 as two different time points for globalization. Based on the definition of globalization as the integration of transnational commodity markets, and verification of commodity price convergence and economic model, the authors points out that the 1820s was accompanied by ships, railways, the demise of mercantilism, the rise of trade liberalization, and the disappearance of trade monopolies ushering in the true era of globalization in world history.

&emsp;Columbus's discovery of the American continent in 1492 and Vasco da Gama's discovery of the eastbound route in 1498 triggered an unprecedented large-scale transfer of technology, plants, animals, and diseases. However, the direct impact on trade and globalization is another story. To realize the full economic impact of the voyage of discovery required the movement of populations along frontiers and the deployment of European capital to those frontiers. But more importantly, the monopoly of long-distance trade also needs to be broken, and a revolution in transportation technology is needed to make it cheaper to transport commodities between continents, so that domestic prices and domestic resource allocation are significantly affected by international trade.
<br/>

&emsp;The authors uses commodity price difference changes as an indicator and analyzes the factors that affect the changes. The results of the study pointed out that there was no obvious price convergence in global prices before the 19th century for competitive goods and no evidence was seen of long-distance prices before the 18th century.One sees no evidence of significant price convergence in the non-competitive goods that were the mainstay of long-distance trade before the eighteenth century—such as European exports of woolen cloth and imports of silk, spices, tea, and porcelain. Although the price difference of some commodities has narrowed, it is only due to special circumstances or non-technological innovation factors that have lowered costs.
<br/>

&emsp;The authors use the relative factor prices, commodity prices and factor endowments and trends (TREND) in Britain in the past four centuries to illustrate that before the 19th century, relative commodity prices(PAPM) and relative factor prices(WR) is closely related to the land to labor ratio  (LANDLAB), and the relationship between the two became more independent after the French Wars and the repeal of the Corn Laws. The coefficient of the Coefficient of WR shows that the open economic model is very consistent with the period after 1828, but is very inconsistent with the period before 1828. At the same time, the TREND, which includes the impact of capital deepening and technological innovation, has a significant positive effect on WR after the 1820s. After the 1820s, long-distance trade between continents developed as transportation costs, monopolies, mercantilist intervention, piracy, and international conflicts declined.
