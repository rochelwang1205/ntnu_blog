> 文本：Why Don’t Trade Preference Reflect Economic Self-Interest?<br/>


Hello everyone, what I want to introduce next is the research by Sungmin Rho and Michael Tomz: Why Don’t Trade Preference Reflect Economic Self-Interest?

**Table of Contents**

I will first explain the research motivation and research questions, and use the table  in the article to illustrate the research results. Finally, I will summarize the key points and contributions of this paper.

**01 Motivation**

**Recent studies: Self-interest doesn’t play more important role in policy preference**

In the field of IPE, research always assumes that people are self-interested, and this is true in many early studies. However, more and more recent studies have shown that self-interest does not play a key factor that affects people’s policy preferences. This happens "After controlling for other predictors of public opinion";

Other researchers, such as Hainmueller and Hiscox, said "Strong correlation between variables like education and policy preference doesn’t reflect self-interest";

Others "Analyzing opinions about protectionism for specific industries, as well as sentiment toward free trade in general shows little evidence that voters define their interests in rational, material ways."

So,why does self-interest have so little predictive power?

**Why does self-interest have so little predictive power?**

The authors give three possible reasons：At first, individual preferences are determined by nonmaterial considerations, such as ideology,nationalism, ethnocentrism, racism, and social trust.

Moreover,People weigh material considerations but focus on society as a whole; or People do not understand how trade affects their material welfare.

Regarding these three possible reasons, the authors tend to believe that people's ignorance of the economy is the main reason.

**02 Research Questions & Methods**

Under the premise that the authors believe that Economic knowledge has a powerful effect on whether citizens express self-serving preferences,

They need to study two questions: first, they must verify How much people actually know about trade.

and then use information about trade policy consequences as variables to study whether people will have more reasonable policy preferences because they get more information.

The research methods and tools used were Survey on US adult and Statistical Analysis.

**03 Findings**

Before discussing the findings, we need to know：

In Stolper–Samuelson theorem, an increase in the relative price of a product will increase the real returns to the factor used most intensively to make the product while decreasing the real earnings of other factors of production.

So what does this mean in simple terms?

As Table 1 summarizes these predictions, for example, the US government limited imports of other items made by foreign workers without college degrees. The relative price of those products would rise, helping low-educated Americans at the expense of highly educated ones. Limiting imports made by foreigners with college degrees would have the opposite effect: helping Americans with college degrees while hurting Americans without college degrees.

In addition, we also need to know that the study also included the variable of education because:

The authors want to maximize comparability with previous research. Nearly all previous studies about trade preferences have treated education as the key factor of production;helped make the survey accessible to respondents. Ordinary citizens understand the idea of formal education and can easily imagine products made by people with and without college degrees; The third reason is easier to measure than alternative concepts, such as skill.

Now let’s look at the results of the study.

**Q1: How much do people actually know about trade?**

As can be seen in Table 2, the survey shows that the respondents do not show obvious policy preferences for policies that restrict the higher-education import or lower-education import. In Table 3, we do not see any significant differences in policies between respondents with different education levels: the proportions are very close, with only a difference of 1% to 4%.

In sum，ordinary Americans know little about the economic consequences of trade explain the puzzling mismatch between the material interests of citizens and their trade policy preferences.

Moreover, studies have shown that low levels of economic knowledge are prevalent not only in the United States but also in other countries . For example, a significant percentage of Spanish citizens admitted to having little to no knowledge about the consequences of raising or lifting barriers to foreign imports. This lack of awareness can result in uninformed or misguided trade preferences among the public.

In essence, economic ignorance can lead individuals to form trade preferences that do not necessarily reflect their economic self-interest. Without a clear understanding of how trade policies impact various groups in society, individuals may base their preferences on incomplete or inaccurate information, potentially leading to suboptimal policy choices.

Given low levels of knowledge in society as a whole, The authors think that if we informed citizens about the winners and losers from trade, opinions could shift significantly.

**Effect of Distributional Cues on people**

Distributional cues can have two opposing effects on individuals' policy preferences, as highlighted by Rho and Tomz :

Self-serving Policy Preferences: When individuals are provided with information about the winners and losers of trade policies, they may become more likely to express self-serving policy preferences. This means that they are more inclined to support policies that directly benefit themselves or their specific group. By understanding how trade policies affect their own economic interests, individuals can advocate for measures that align with their personal financial well-being.

Altruistic Consideration: On the other hand, distributional cues can also make individuals more sensitive to the interests of others. This altruistic response involves individuals considering how trade policies impact different groups in society beyond just themselves. By becoming more aware of the distributional consequences of trade, individuals may be motivated to support policies that benefit broader societal welfare, even if those policies do not directly benefit them personally.

**Effect of Distributional Cues on people with College Degree**

As can be seen in Figure 1, people with college degrees have greater changes in policy preferences after learning who is the winner and who is the loser in the two policies, and they tend to support or oppose policies that benefit themself.

**Effect of Distributional Cues on people without College Degree**

In FIGURE 2, when it comes to the policy of restricting  low-educated imports, respondents without a college degree are more altruistic after knowing more information. The policy of restricting the higher-education imports shows a mixture of altruism and self-interest.

Overall, while self-serving responses tend to outweigh altruistic ones in the context of trade policy preferences, the interplay between these two effects demonstrates the complexity of how individuals respond to information about the distributional effects of trade.

Do cues cause the preference of ordinary citizens to become more consistent with Stolper—Samuelson in overall effect?

The cues provided in the study  had mixed effects on the preferences of ordinary citizens in terms of consistency with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem.

Under the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, there should be a negative relationship between a person's education level and their desire to limit low-education imports, and a positive relationship between education level and the desire to limit high-education imports. However, the study found that when respondents received no cues, individuals with college degrees were less willing to limit both low-education and high-education imports, contrary to the predictions of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem.

When distributional cues about winners and losers were introduced, the effects on individuals' preferences varied. While the cues elicited both self-serving and altruistic responses, the overall impact on the alignment of preferences with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem was not explicitly stated in the provided excerpts. The study highlighted that cues strengthened the negative correlation between education and limits on low-education imports, but also reversed the observed correlation between education and limits on high-education imports, making attitudes more consistent with Stolper-Samuelson in some cases.

Therefore, the cues did have an impact on individuals' preferences, but the extent to which they made the preferences of ordinary citizens more consistent with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem varied depending on the specific context and the type of trade policy being considered.

**Conclusion**

To summarize, this paper provides a foundation for more nuanced and behaviorally informed theories in international political economy by exploring the complexities of how economic ignorance and distributional cues influence individuals' policy preferences.

to say details：

1. **Selfishness of policy preference should be seen as a variable that depends on causal beliefs – who would win and lose from government policies.**

Challenging Assumptions: The research challenges the traditional assumption in international political economy that individuals' policy preferences reflect their economic self-interest. By demonstrating that economic ignorance can lead to preferences that do not align with self-interest models, the study prompts a reevaluation of existing theories.

1. Behaviorally Informed Theories: By **highlighting the role of beliefs and information in shaping policy preferences**, the research advocates for behaviorally informed theories in international political economy. Understanding how individuals respond to distributional cues and economic information can lead to more nuanced and realistic theoretical frameworks .
2. Consideration of Heterogeneity: The study uncovers **significant heterogeneity across individuals in how they respond to economic cues.** By recognizing this diversity in responses, future research can delve deeper into understanding why certain groups exhibit specific reactions to information, leading to more comprehensive theories .
3. Importance of Information: The research underscores the importance of information in shaping preferences and policy outcomes. By emphasizing the impact of knowledge on individuals' trade preferences, the study **highlights the need to consider the role of information dissemination in the international political economy** .

The above is my introduction to this paper, thank you for listening.
