## **speech note**
"Good morning everyone. Today, I'll be discussing a summary about the Cold War and U.S. foreign policy. Then discussing the question related to the topic.<br/>

The Cold War began in the mid-1940s and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. This nearly half-century confrontation had its roots in historical enmity, economic rivalry, ideological crusades, and geopolitical power struggles.<br/>

1. Before 1945, U.S.-Soviet relations were complex and varied. Despite forming a temporary alliance during World War II, mutual suspicions persisted. <br/>

2. In the Post-war, economic factors intensified tensions. The U.S. halted its Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union and emerged as the world's economic superpower. Disagreements over Germany's economic future also became a point of contention.<br/>

3. Ideological differences further deepened the divide. The incompatibility of Western capitalism and Soviet communism, along with disputes over democracy and freedom in Eastern Europe, became central to the conflict.<br/>

4. Geopolitically, while the U.S. had unprecedented power, it also recognized its vulnerabilities. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, focused on establishing a buffer zone in Eastern Europe to ensure its security.<br/>
    
In response to this situation, the U.S. gradually developed its containment policy. <br/>
George Kennan's Long Telegram and 'X' article laid the theoretical foundation for this strategy. Churchill's Iron Curtain speech further heightened Western vigilance against the Soviet Union. Let’s watch a video talking about the details about the Long Telegram and Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.[The Cold War: George Kennan's Long Telegram and Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech - Episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q54ScgX7-94&t=99s)<br/>

The Truman Doctrine remarked on the beginning of the Cold War.There’s another video to  introduce How the Truman Doctrine Established the Cold War.[Here's How the Truman Doctrine Established the Cold War | History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb8aW46T3bg&t=96s)<br/>

A series of events, including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, formation of NATO, and the Berlin Blockade, marked the formal implementation of the containment policy. <br/>

The core of the containment strategy was to prevent Soviet expansion and maintain Western advantage in key industrial centers. However, the advent of nuclear weapons dramatically changed the nature of the Cold War. U.S. nuclear strategy evolved from massive retaliation to flexible response, developing concepts such as Mutual Assured Destruction, essential equivalence, and countervailing strategy.<br/>

The implementation of containment policy had profound effects on the U.S. It led to the establishment of an extensive alliance network but also created dilemmas in balancing national interests and principles. <br/>

Beyond military means, economic, diplomatic, and psychological warfare also became important tools of the Cold War.<br/>

In conclusion, the origins and development of the Cold War were complex processes involving multiple factors. While the containment policy largely shaped the U.S. Cold War strategy, its implementation was full of contradictions and challenges. Ultimately, the human factor played a crucial role in Cold War decision-making.<br/>

Before we go to the discussion section, I will wrap up the key terms mentioned above based on text.<br/>

The following we will discuss the question related to the assigned readings. <br/>
## **relevant question to discuss**
<br/>
Q：The text discusses the challenge of determining what constituted the national interest in a policy of containment. How do you think the experience of the Cold War continues to influence US foreign policy and international relations today?How would you define "national interest" in today’s world?
<br/>
Thank you for those insights.To wrap up, I'd like to offer a few key takeaways.
- How the Cold War experience continues to influence US foreign policy and international relations today
	- Persistence of containment strategies
	- Maintenance of global military presence and alliances
	- deological factors in foreign policy (e.g., promoting democracy)
	- Evolution of US-Russia and US-China relations
	- Impact on arms control and nuclear proliferation policies
- but, some new factors need to be considered in the post-cold war
	- Globalization and economic interdependence
	- Rise of non-traditional security threats (e.g., terrorism, climate change)
	- Shift towards multilateralism in some areas

- Defining "national interest" in today's world
	- Traditional aspects (security, economic prosperity, political stability)
	- Evolving concepts of national interest in a globalized world
	- Balancing domestic needs with international responsibilities
	- Short-term vs. long-term interests
	- Role of soft power and cultural influence
	- Addressing transnational challenges (climate change, pandemics, etc.)

Thank you for your attention.
