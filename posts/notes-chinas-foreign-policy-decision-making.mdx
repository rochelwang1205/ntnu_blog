Good morning everyone! Today, we’re going to present on China’s foreign policy decision-making process, drawing from two key academic papers:

1. More than Peripheral: How Provinces Influence China’s Foreign Policy by Audrye Wong
2. Domestic Bureaucratic Politics and Chinese Foreign Policy by Hongyi Lai and Su-Jeong Kang

These papers provide different perspectives on how China’s foreign policy is shaped—by bureaucratic agencies, provincial governments, and top leadership.

### Paper 1: More than Peripheral: How Provinces Influence China’s Foreign Policy

1. Opening:
- Traditionally, most analyses of China’s foreign and security policies assume that all strategic decisions are formulated by the central government. However, Wong challenges this view, arguing that China’s provincial governments play a significant role in shaping and implementing foreign policy.

2. Why Yunnan and Hainan as Case Studies?
- The author selects Yunnan and Hainan because they are peripheral provinces in China’s political system yet still manage to influence foreign policy.
- Yunnan’s role: Plays a key role in China’s relations with Southeast Asia, particularly in economic cooperation, energy security (e.g., China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines), and border security policies.
- Hainan’s role: Central to China’s South China Sea policy, influencing maritime sovereignty claims and regional diplomacy.
    
3. Mechanisms of Provincial Influence:
- The paper identifies three ways provinces exert influence:
	1. Trailblazing – Provinces introduce new policies and persuade the central government to adopt them (e.g., Yunnan’s promotion of the China-Myanmar pipeline).
    2. Carpetbagging – Provinces modify national policy implementation to serve local interests (e.g., Hainan’s upgrading of Sansha City for more funding).
    3. Resisting – Provinces delay or refuse to implement policies that harm local priorities (e.g., Hainan’s resistance to Beijing’s fishing bans).
4. Findings:
- As China expands its foreign policy initiatives—such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—provincial governments are given increasing responsibilities in policy execution.
- While the central government retains control over key foreign policy decisions, provinces influence foreign policy through interpretation, new initiatives, or resistance.
- Yunnan’s economic and energy strategies have shaped China’s bilateral relations with Myanmar, and Hainan’s assertive actions in the South China Sea have shaped maritime policies.

2. Limitations (as mentioned by the author):
- China’s political system remains highly centralized, meaning that while provincial governments exert influence, they are unlikely to fully control foreign policy.
- Many interview respondents were unwilling to openly discuss provincial actions that contradict central government interests, which may limit the comprehensiveness of the study’s findings.

### Paper 2: Domestic Bureaucratic Politics and Chinese Foreign Policy

1. Opening:
- The bureaucratic system plays a crucial role in China's foreign policy decision-making, second only to the top leadership.
- This paper examines bureaucratic politics in Chinese foreign policymaking, focusing on three aspects:
	- The structure of the decision-making system, particularly the key participating agencies.
	- The responsibilities of these agencies and their roles in the process.
	- Inter-agency coordination and conflict resolution.

2. Findings:
- While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) remains central, other ministries—such as the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of National Defense, and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)—have gained increasing influence in areas like diplomacy, trade, climate change, military affairs, and soft power development.
- The growing role of the Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group (CFALSG) is crucial in overseeing foreign policy decisions and coordinating policy implementation.

3. Bureaucratic Structure of Foreign Policy Making:
- Politburo and its Standing Committee:
- The Politburo (formerly 25 members, now 24 members) follows a collective decision-making model based on informed deliberation and consensus.
- The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) consists of the top seven officials who give final approval to key foreign and security policy decisions.
- Leading Small Groups (LSGs):
	- LSGs are cross-agency bodies established by the CCP Central Committee to promote consensus and coordinate policy-making among the Party, government, and military institutions.
	- LSGs deliberate major policy decisions and submit recommendations to the Politburo or the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) for approval.
- Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group (CFALSG):
	- CFALSG is a specialized LSG dedicated to foreign affairs, serving as a key coordinating body in China’s foreign policy decision-making.
	- It is led by the CCP General Secretary and PRC President (currently Xi Jinping) and is responsible for deliberating major foreign policy decisions and submitting recommendations to the PSC.
	- Other related LSGs, such as the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Leading Group, also influence foreign economic policy, but CFALSG remains the central body in China’s foreign policy decision-making.
- The Importance of CFALSG
	- As China’s global influence expands, its foreign policy has become increasingly complex, necessitating a more efficient mechanism to coordinate the positions of different government agencies.
	- CFALSG ensures that various institutions (such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), and Ministry of National Defense) act in alignment with China’s foreign policy objectives, preventing conflicts and inconsistencies in policy execution.
- Ministries, Departments, and Agencies of the Government and the Party:
	- MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs): Manages diplomatic relations and international negotiations.
	- MOFCOM (Ministry of Commerce):
	- In the 1980s-1990s, it focused only on technical economic affairs, with diplomacy led by the MFA.
	- Since China’s WTO accession (2001), MOFCOM has played a leading role in trade negotiations and FTAs, even influencing China’s international strategy.
- NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission):
	- Initially focused on domestic economic planning but now plays a key role in energy diplomacy and infrastructure investment.
	- PBC (People’s Bank of China) & Ministry of Finance:
	- Originally responsible for domestic fiscal policies but now increasingly influential in international financial governance and the renminbi’s global role.
- CFALSG (Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group): Ensures coordination and alignment across government agencies.
- The Party’s International Department & UFWD: Involved in state-to-state diplomatic relations and foreign influence efforts.
- DOP (Propaganda Department): Oversees media, public opinion, and censorship related to foreign affairs.
- The Ministry of Culture & MOE (Ministry of Education): Guides cultural diplomacy and international academic exchanges.
