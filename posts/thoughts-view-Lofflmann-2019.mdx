<br/>

&emsp;Since there’s little discussion about the relationship between populism and foreign policy,  Löfflmann (2019) argues that making America foreign policy following public opinion damages national security. Trump’s nationalist populism destroyed the US state quo and lost liberal alliances since the Cold War. It's a contrast to “America first” or “make America great again”.
<br/>
&emsp;Populism divided people but, what’s worse, a leader who has power to decide foreign affairs impresses on populism would be a true catastrophe. Trump’s core premises about America's role and international standing including The United States needs to reassess its overextended international commitments and engagements; strengthen burden-sharing with allies and partners; oppose the Iran nuclear agreement; rebuild trust with Israel and Saudi Arabia; and restore global respect for the United States. 
<br/>
&emsp;However, compared to the fact, there's a gap between the Trump administration's proclaimed anti-globalist preference. Löfflmann (2019) explained that the implementation of significant national security policy shifts within the United States' extensive defense apparatus faced both procedural and substantive impediments. Pre-existing military commitments created operational inertia that prevented rapid strategic realignment. Moreover, Trump encountered institutional resistance from the foreign policy and national security bureaucracy's established interagency processes.
<br/>
&emsp;Following the departures of National Security Advisor McMaster, Secretary of State Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, Trump appointed conservative nationalists and technocrats more sympathetic to the America First doctrine's emphasis on national sovereignty and transactional diplomacy. However, transformative policy objectives such as forging a strategic alignment with Russia, NATO withdrawal, or significant troop reductions in key allied nations (South Korea, Germany, and Japan) remained unattainable.
<br/>
&emsp;The fundamental structural reorientation of American geopolitical posture proved politically unfeasible, encountering robust bipartisan congressional opposition and public resistance. This demonstrates the resilience of post-World War II international order and the institutional constraints on executive authority in US foreign policy-making.
<br/>
&emsp;The root contradiction between institutional and traditional foreign policy frameworks and Trump's proclaimed anti-globalization, protectionist labor policies, and discriminatory rhetoric lies in their profound misalignment with national security imperatives. The logic of operationalizing foreign policy from a purely domestic constituency perspective fundamentally diverges from strategic national interests. Moreover, the partisan polarization manifests distinctly in foreign policy disagreements, revealing a significant absence of consensual strategic direction. 
<br/>
&emsp;Löfflmann (2019) provides a concise yet comprehensive analysis of populism's impact on United States foreign policy, utilizing the 2016 presidential election as a critical temporal marker. The scholarly examination leverages public opinion data to contextualize the pre-election socioeconomic landscape and systematically chronicles the Trump administration's policy pronouncements and actions. Through meticulous documentation, the analysis substantiates the argument that populist rhetoric and approach precipitated substantial transformations in American foreign policy paradigms.
<br/>
&emsp;The analysis of the disconnect between foreign policy elites and public opinion is nuanced and well-supported by polling data. Also, The argument that Trump's approach exposed structural tensions in US foreign policy thinking is compelling. The detailed examination of the gap between Trump's rhetoric and actual policy implementation provides valuable insight.
<br/>
&emsp;Though the article connected the populist and foreign policy,the claim that America First represents a fully coherent alternative strategic vision seems overstated, given the author's own evidence of inconsistency. The assessment of Trump's impact on global order appears somewhat speculative, particularly regarding long-term implications. Löfflmann's (2019) analysis of populism as a foreign policy practice is limited, focusing primarily on leadership perspectives. By narrowing the examination to leadership dynamics, the study fails to provide a comprehensive explanation of populism's underlying causes, thereby rendering its interpretative framework somewhat incomplete and less persuasive.
<br/>
&emsp;The etiology of populism is multifaceted, emerging from the intricate interplay of economic, social, cultural trends, and institutional deterioration. This phenomenon can be analytically approached through two primary lenses: first, the evolving dissatisfaction and demands of citizens, and second, the transformative nature of democratic institutions, particularly the increasing ineffectiveness or reluctance of elites and institutional frameworks to respond to public expectations. The 2024 United States presidential election results exemplify a critical insight for liberalist thought: emotional satisfaction may precede rational discourse, suggesting that addressing affective dimensions could be fundamental to meaningful political communication.Conversely, the long-term economic landscape, characterized by what scholars term "Angrynomics" under capitalist structures, reveals a growing dissonance between societal expectations and actual outcomes, even amid ostensibly positive economic indicators.
<br/>
&emsp;To address the persistent socioeconomic challenges emerging from the 2008 financial crisis — particularly the systemic anger generated by wealth inequality — pragmatic policy interventions should draw lessons from historical economic experiences, such as the 1930s American Great Depression and the 1970s stagflation era. Specifically, policymakers should consider establishing a sovereign wealth fund and implementing a dual-rate system, whereby lending rates are strategically differentiated. Such an approach would prioritize broader wealth distribution without pursuing unrealistic employment rates or absolute inflation stability.This nuanced perspective underscores the complexity of populist dynamics, emphasizing the need for holistic, context-sensitive analytical frameworks that transcend simplistic leadership-centric interpretations.
<br/>
&emsp;Löfflmann (2019) briefly mentioned social media (particularly Twitter) amplifying populist sentiments without extensive elaboration. Trump's dissatisfaction with the 2020 election and subsequent mobilization of voters vividly demonstrates the now-undeniable power of social media. A report from a European research institution highlighted the "democratic backsliding" phenomenon, where democratically elected governments gradually erode and undermine democratic institutions, regulations, and traditions. Specifically, Trump's unfounded allegations regarding the 2020 U.S. election were identified as a critical turning point in American democratic history.
<br/>
&emsp;Trump effectively acted as a catalyst, accelerating political polarization and democratic degradation. His actions included spreading misinformation, making baseless accusations about the U.S. electoral system, and inciting violence. Consequently, the Republican Party has been increasingly dominated by far-right political actors.
<br/>
&emsp;Critically, social media failed to foster neutral discourse and critical thinking. Instead, users typically rely on contextual cues when sharing posts, and the platform's inherent dynamics exacerbate this issue. Given that negative messaging tends to attract more attention—a fundamental human psychological trait—and the market concentration of social media platforms, the distortion and dissemination of misleading content have been significantly amplified.
<br/>
&emsp;To conclude, it will be much persuasive if the author (1)provides more comparative analysis with previous presidential foreign policy approaches;(2) develops a more rigorous theoretical framework for understanding populist foreign policy;(3) includes more international perspectives on the America First doctrine;(4) offers more concrete predictions about the long-term structural changes initiated by this approach.
<br/>
&emsp;Löfflmann (2019) provides a sophisticated scholarly analysis of a complex political phenomenon. Its strength lies in its nuanced approach, combining theoretical insights with empirical evidence. The author successfully navigates the challenging terrain of interpreting a controversial political period, offering balanced critical analysis that avoids both uncritical acceptance and reflexive dismissal of Trump's foreign policy approach.
<br/>
&emsp;The piece makes a significant contribution to understanding the intersection of populism, nationalism, and foreign policy, presenting a thoughtful examination of a pivotal moment in US international relations.
