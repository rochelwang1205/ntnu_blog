description: In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that Obama's foreign policy challenges weren't primarily due to public isolationism, but rather stemmed from leadership and implementation issues. His tendency to prioritize his personal worldview over public opinion, combined with inconsistent policy implementation, contributed to declining public approval and concerns about America's global standing.

## **Iran nuclear program and Israel**

First, regarding the Iran nuclear program. While the public supported diplomatic negotiations, there was deep skepticism about Iran's intentions. Specifically, 68% of Americans believed Iran was either "not too likely" or "not at all likely" to abide by a nuclear agreement. Moreover, the public strongly rejected Obama's attempt to bypass Congressional review of the Iran deal.<br/>

Second, concerning Israel relations. The data shows significant public disapproval of Obama's handling of U.S.-Israel relations. About 62% disapproved of his approach to Israeli-Palestinian relations, and a majority believed the U.S. should leave negotiations to the direct parties rather than taking a leading role.<br/>

## **U.S. Global Standing**

Perhaps most concerning was the public perception of America's global standing during this period. The polling data reveals that 53% of Americans believed the United States was playing a less important role as a world leader than a decade ago. Even more striking, 70% felt the United States was less respected internationally under Obama's leadership.<br/>

The public demonstrated a clear preference for maintaining American military supremacy, with 56% stating that U.S. policies should keep it as the only military superpower in the world.<br/>

## **Partisan Polarization**

Finally, we must address the significant partisan divide in foreign policy perspectives. The research shows a growing polarization between Republican and Democratic views on foreign policy threats and approaches. Republicans consistently showed less confidence in Obama's foreign policy decisions, while Democrats generally supported his approach.<br/>

Particularly noteworthy is that by 2014, Republicans held a 23-percentage-point advantage over Democrats in public trust regarding protection from international terrorism and military threats.<br/>

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that Obama's foreign policy challenges weren't primarily due to public isolationism, but rather stemmed from leadership and implementation issues. His tendency to prioritize his personal worldview over public opinion, combined with inconsistent policy implementation, contributed to declining public approval and concerns about America's global standing.<br/>

The study suggests that future presidents, regardless of party affiliation, might benefit from adopting a more assertive leadership style in foreign policy formulation and implementation, while maintaining clear communication with the public about policy objectives and strategies.<br/>
